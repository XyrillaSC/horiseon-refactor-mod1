# Horiseon Social Solution Services Refactor (Module 1 Challenge)

## Description

Over the corse of this refactor, I replaced non-semantic elements with their newer and more accessible counterparts in order to meet accessability standards.

To further achieve a more accessible state, I added alternate descriptions to all images and adjusted headings in order to better represent their uses on the webpage.

Finally, general polish has been added to the code as it has been properly commented, as well as adjusted to provide more clarity as to the use of some class selectors.
